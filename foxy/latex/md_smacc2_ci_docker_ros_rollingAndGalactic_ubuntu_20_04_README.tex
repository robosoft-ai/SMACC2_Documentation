Docker allows you to run your applications in a lean environment known as a container.

This dockerfile allows you to select your preferred ROS distro as an argument at runtime. To build the docker image use this command\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}sudo docker build --build-arg ROS2_DISTRO=(desiredRosTag) (directoryHoldingDockerfile)/
\end{DoxyVerb}


ROS rolling will act as default if no argument is provided.
